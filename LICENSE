#Deep Local Analysis (DLA)-Ranker is a deep learning framework applying 3D convolutions 
#to a set of locally oriented cubes representing the protein interface. It explicitly considers 
#the local geometry of the interfacial residues along with their neighboring atoms and the regions of 
#the interface with different solvent accessibility. DLA-Ranker identifies near-native conformations 
#and discovers alternative interfaces from ensembles generated by molecular docking.
